-> To fight climate change, we need to use clean energy like green hydrogen. But people have to trust that the hydrogen is really made in a clean and honest way. 
Our project uses blockchain to keep track of every kilogram of green hydrogen — like a digital certificate. This makes sure it’s real, can be shared, and can’t be used more than once. 
We also use smart technology to check the rules, confirm the information, and keep everything clear and safe. This helps meet the clean energy rules in places like Europe and the U.S.

-> Our goal is to build a blockchain-based system that keeps track of green hydrogen in a safe, transparent way. This system will allow hydrogen credits to be issued (created), 
transferred (shared), and retired (marked as used) so they can't be reused or faked.

-> To make sure producers are following the rules, we will check that the hydrogen is made using renewable electricity from the same region and during the correct time period. 
For example, the EU has a rule called RFNBO — it says the electricity used must match the hydrogen production by month until 2029, and by hour starting in 2030. 
We will also check that the producer has a power purchase agreement (PPA) to buy clean energy, which proves the hydrogen is truly green.

-> To make the system trustworthy, we will use verifiable credentials — these are digital proofs that show a hydrogen plant is certified,
that the emissions from making the hydrogen are calculated correctly, and that an auditor has approved everything.

-> We will also stop double counting — which means the same hydrogen credit can't be used more than once — by checking if a Guarantee of Origin (GO) certificate has already been used.

->Finally, we will build a simple and easy-to-use dashboard so that producers, buyers, auditors, and regulators can all interact with the system, see the credits, and trust that everything is fair and verified.
